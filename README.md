# Machine Learning Regression Exercise

In this exercise, the goal is to predict the number of rented bike based on type of day (holiday, working day) and external factors (season, weather, temperature, felt temperature, humidity, and windspeed).

It's interesting to note that actually trying to predict the future (instead of just using random splits in the data) does much worse in terms of explained variance.
